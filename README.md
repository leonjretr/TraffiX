  This web game was supposed to be commercial, however, due to lack of time, my friend and I couldn't finish it.



Front-end part was nearly finished, but it was the back-end part that we couldn't complete.

API was made, though it doesn't work at the moment.


I will try to bring it to a more presentable state in the nearest couple of months.
